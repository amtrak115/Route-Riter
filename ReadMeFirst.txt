Route_Riter v7.1.29 upgrade
---------------------------

This package will upgrade Route_Riter v7.0.85 or later to v7.1.29

To Install

1. Go to your current Route_Riter folder and DELETE the folders
	 BrakeFiles and Couplings
	 also delete Route_Riter.exe and Route_Riter.chm
	 
2. Unzip the contents of this file into the Route_Riter folder.

Please read the Route_Riter.chm HELP file, especially the section
on Turbo-Bill's Brakes and Couplers.

Please note that virtually all the updates in this version are
to the Licenced version of Route_Riter, although it does fix a
few minor bugs in all versions.

Following a Microsoft upgrade to Vista, some users may not be able
to view the Help files in Route_Riter. If this happens to you, see
the entry 13. in my FAQ page, a link is on my site as under.
