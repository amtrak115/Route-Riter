When making the low poly versions of the default wagons I had a problem.

I needed to know the exact position and size of the various parts in order to model them.

My solution was to make a measuring tool.

This is a grid of poles placed 0.5m apart.
To use it you first load the vehicle to be measured into Shape Viewer.
Then go to File/Open Secon Shape and load the MeasuringTool.s
Get rid of the perspective by clicking Tools/Orthogonal Projection.

You will then be able to read off the sizes by counting the 0.5m lines.

You can see on the screenshot that the body is 11m long and the centre of the coupling knuckles are 12m apart. This is the length you need for the size line.

To find the exact size you need to go to File/Position Second Shape. 

The screenshot shows how to find the exact hight of the bottom of the frame.
The grid is moved up to line up with frame and the distance moved can be read off in the position window. Note this down and move the grid to the top of the wagon, subtract the 1.03 and you have the hight of the wagon body.


The measuring tool has many other uses.

You can find the exact figures for the size and bounding box.

You can find the position of the driver in order to position the cabview.
If you zoom in close you will even see the poles pushing up thru the floor on the inside. This can also be used to position passenger views.

You can load in a freight animation tail lamp shape, move it to the correct position and use the figures to shift it in Shape File Manager. Then find the position of the lens for the lighting section.

Find the position of the chimney or exhaust for the smoke effects.

You could even load it as a freight animation on a loco to  measure scenic items.


The Measuring tool folder can be placed in the Trainset folder for ease of use but I prefer to place the shape file and the ace in the Default folder where it is easily found and does no harm.
