TK_Utils - Archibald, Horace, Mapper & Zipper
Archibald is a tree view editor for MSTS files capable of 
reading/writing compressed shape, terrain and world files.
Horace is a route converter when doing changes to the
tsection.dat file like installing XTracks first time.
Mapper is for doing maps and profiles of routes.
Zipper last but not least is an easy to use compression 
utility that also handles folders. This update improves 
some file handling and adds a search function in Archibald.
