</CENTER>
<P>TgaTool started life as a simple tool for editing Targa files using any Paint program. Because very few paint
programs directly support Alpha channels it was necessary to create a program that would let you split the 32 bit
Targa information into seperate (and seperately-editable) files that could be handled even by MSPaint. The tool
also needed to recombine the data when you saved so that you could create new Targa files still containing all
the RGB and Alpha data. TgaTool works by seperating the 32 bit RGBA data into 2 files. One 24 bit file containg
the RGB data and one 8 bit (256 greyscale) file containing the alpha data. These can be sent to whatever Paint
program you have selected where they can be edited normally. Once the paint program has finished editing TgaTool
will replace its displayed data with the new, edited, version.</P>
<P>When Trainsim came along it provided many sample textures in Targa and Bmp format. These are not actually used
in Trainsim but are able to be converted to the correct ACE format using the tools supplied with the game. However
this meant the only textures you could modify were the ones they had provided Targa or Bmp templates for.</P>
<P>Once the Ace format had been decoded it was possible to add the facility to open Ace textures and save them
out as new Targa or Bmp templates for later editing. It is also possible to edit any of the formats directly in
TgaTool2 by passing the data back and forth between TgaTool2 and any paint program. As there are still very few
paint programs that correctly support Alpha channels TgaTool2 makes it possible to edit these textures in any paint
program (including the free MSPaint program that is included with Windows).</P>

<P>Edit the main image by either selecting &quot;Send Main Image to Editor&quot; from the Image menu or just Double-click
on the Image. This will send it to the currently selected editing program (initial default MSPaint). Once finished
editing Save (not Save As) from the Editing program and your edited version will be displayed when you returnto
the TgaTool2 window. With most Paint programs the quickest and easiest way to ensure you correctly save your edited
file is to just close the Paint program. It should then pop up a message asking if you wish to save the changed
image and saying Yes or OK to this will correctly save it so that TgaTool2 can locate and reload the data.<BR>

loaded a BMP or ACE image then you will be prompted for a Targa file to save the data to. Note that &quot;Save&quot;

</CENTER>
<P><BR>
Many images do not have an alpha channel. If, as part of the editing process, you wish to add an alpha channel
so that transparencies can be included then you can use the buttons under the Alpha thumbnail to create the alpha
channel.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Create Alpha Channel&quot; will create a blank (fully opaque) alpha channel which you can then edit to add
transparent areas.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Create Alpha Template&quot; will create an alpha channel as a greyscale copy of the main image. This will
make it easier to see exactly where you want to apply the transparency. Once the transparent areas have been painted
in black you will need to paint over the non-transparent areas in white.</P>
<CENTER>
<P>
<HR ALIGN="CENTER">
<A NAME="EDITING ALPHA"></A><B>Alpha Tips</B></P>
</CENTER>
<P><BR>
When you send the alpha channel to your paint program for editing you should think of it as a transparency map
that is applied to the actual pixels in the main image. Each point on the alpha will correspond to the same point
on the main image and the grey level will decide how much transparency is applied to the main image at that point.
Black will give fully-transparent. White will give fully opaque and any shade of grey inbetween will give a partial
transparency based on what level it is between White and Black.<BR>
<BR>
Note also that the actual transparency included when you export in ACE format depends on the type of ACE you select.
Ace(Alpha) will use all the transparency if possible. Ace(-trans) will convert the alpha to 1-bit (ie just on or
off) and Ace(no alpha) will not use the alpha channel at all.</P>
<P><BR>
There are further restrictions imposed by MakeAce. It will only allow full alpha for images that are square and
no bigger than 512x512. All other sizes will be treated as if they were -trans.</P>

		<TD WIDTH="65%" VALIGN="TOP"><FONT SIZE="2">TgaTool2 will normally use the system TEMP folder for the storing of the temporary files it creates.
			You can use this option to specify an alternative location. This can be useful if you want to be able to access
			the Image and Alpha data directly.<BR>

			The dialog that appears will let you browse to any folder on any of your drives. It will also let you set the location
			back to the system TEMP location if required.</FONT></TD>

		<TD WIDTH="65%" VALIGN="TOP"><FONT SIZE="1">By default TgaTool2 will run your selected Paint Program as a sub-process. This means that TgaTool2
			will be disabled until you have finished your editing and closed down the Paint program. It will then automatically
			update the displayed images if you have made any changes.<BR>
			<BR>
			Previous versions of TgaTool2 used a simpler method that just set the paint program running and then carried on.
			After you had finished your editing then you had to tell TgaTool2 to update its displayed data yourself.<BR>
			<BR>
			Some people may prefer to use the &quot;Old&quot; method. Ticking this menu option will cause TgaTool2 to perform
			the Send to Editor functions in the old way. When you wish to update the displayed data with your edited data you
			must select the &quot;Reload Data&quot; optionb from the Image menu</FONT></TD>
